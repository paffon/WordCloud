# WordCloud
Create a visual Word Cloud (WC) from a list of words and their importance

This simple script allows you to create a word cloud by defining the words in it and their importance.

For example:

words = {
    'Parrot': 100, # very important word
    'Dog': 95, # less important
    'Cat': 81, # less importnat
    'Fish': 17, # really not important
    }
